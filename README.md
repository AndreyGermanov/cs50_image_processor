# CS50 Image Processor

This is a project, which I have done when had been studying the essentials of programming science at the <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/certificates/54809fb7-3204-468e-9d37-bd9654e7295f" target="_blank">CS50 Harvard University program</a>.

This is a standalone web application, used to demonstrate basic image filtering algorithms: blur, edge detection, grayscale, and others. The algorithms were implemented on pure Javascript, using manipulations with a 2d matrix of pixels from HTML5 Canvas. 

This app can be used for educational purposes. All filters, which are possible to find in Photoshop, GIMP, and other image processing software are based on algorithms like those, which implemented here, but of course, more optimized, advanced, and complex.

## Install and Run

Everything is implemented on the client side. Just open `index.html` in your browser and everything is ready. No backend is required.
